# noether 
A small python library for computational abstract algebra designed to make it easy to learn, test conjectures and ideas in a python notebook. 

## Features
Most of basic (finite) group theory has been implemented: 
- There are simple and intuitive ways to define groups, subgroups, homomorphisms, etc. 
- Symmetric/alternating groups, various matrix groups over finite fields, cyclic groups and groups of units of $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$, dihedral groups and the Klein 4 group are all implemented.
- Many of the above groups can be instantiated as matrix groups, or permutation groups.

## Future plans:
- adding the [galois](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois) package for finite field and number theory support
- representation and character theory of finite groups
- group (co)homology

#### You know GAP/Magma/Sage/etc. exists right??
Of course! Those tools are certainly better/faster, this is just for fun.
