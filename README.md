# noether 
A small python library for computational abstract algebra designed to make it easy to learn, test conjectures and ideas in a python notebook. 

## Features
- most of basic (finite) group theory has been implemented - simple and intuitive ways to define groups, subgroups, homomorphisms, cartesian products, etc. 

## Future plans:
- representation and character theory of finite groups
- homological algebra, especially group (co)homology
- ring and field theory
